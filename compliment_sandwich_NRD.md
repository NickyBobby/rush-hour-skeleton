Nicrinna - Halfpoint feedback - NRD - 2/12/2016

1. I love how Erinna is so quick with things, not only on the keyboard (she's very fast) but with her thinking and workflow in general. It really helps me become a better and more efficient programmer.

2. One critique I would have about Erinna is that she might be a little too concerned about where we are in the project in relation to some of the other teams and it stresses her out a little bit. But the truth is that our pace is just fine and if we spent too much time on the earlier iterations I think that it will pay off in the end by having thought through our implementation very well. I think I do a good job of relaxing her by just making sure she knows how dedicated to completing the project I am and we will get through it together.

3. I'm enjoying with Erinna very much and we seem to be having a great while getting out work done. Maybe I joke around a little too much and it's something I need to work on, but I don't think it's effected our work progress too much.

Final Feedback 2/22/16

1. I have to reiterate one of the first points I made in my mid-point feedback. Erinna is super fast with her workflow and thought process. I'm writing this a week after the project was assessed and I've noticed that my own personal speed has increased since working with her.

2. The only critique I can come up with is that she made a few decisions based on what other people were doing, and our implementation was probably fine enough. Having said that, Erinna came up with some amazing code towards the end that really put our project over the top. I would say that she came up with most of the best parts of our project.

3. The other great thing about Erinna during the project is that she was always willing to slow down and explain things to me until I understood it. I learned a lot during this project and that was all due to Erinna.
