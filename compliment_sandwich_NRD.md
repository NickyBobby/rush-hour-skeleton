Nicrinna - Halfpoint feedback - NRD - 2/12/2016

1. I love how Erinna is so quick with things, not only on the keyboard (she's very fast) but with her thinking and workflow in general. It really helps me become a better and more efficient programmer.

2. One critique I would have about Erinna is that she might be a little too concerned about where we are in the project in relation to some of the other teams and it stresses her out a little bit. But the truth is that our pace is just fine and if we spent too much time on the earlier iterations I think that it will pay off in the end by having thought through our implementation very well. I think I do a good job of relaxing her by just making sure she knows how dedicated to completing the project I am and we will get through it together.

3. I'm enjoying with Erinna very much and we seem to be having a great while getting out work done. Maybe I joke around a little too much and it's something I need to work on, but I don't think it's effected our work progress too much.
