Nickrinna - Halfpoint feedback - EMC - 2/13/2016

1. I have really enjoyed working with you. You have been patient and encouraging when I was frustrated with ActiveRecord. You have driven collaboration even when I have wanted to work through issues by myself.

2. We would perhaps work a little better together if we could focus a little bit more. That would probably mean setting up pomodoros and finding the right interval time. We both seem to get really distracted,particularly with Slack and our phones (which I am fully guilty of checking too frequently as well).

3. I enjoy that this project has been a productive and collaborative effort and that we still have time to joke around. Those giphys are out of control (in a good way). Nickrinna 4 LiFe.
