Nickrinna - Halfpoint feedback - EMC - 2/13/2016

1. I have really enjoyed working with you. You have been patient and encouraging when I was frustrated with ActiveRecord. You have driven collaboration even when I have wanted to work through issues by myself.

2. We would perhaps work a little better together if we could focus a little bit more. That would probably mean setting up pomodoros and finding the right interval time. We both seem to get really distracted,particularly with Slack and our phones (which I am fully guilty of checking too frequently as well).

3. I enjoy that this project has been a productive and collaborative effort and that we still have time to joke around. Those giphys are out of control (in a good way). Nickrinna 4 LiFe.


Final feedback - EMC - 2/22/2016

I thought that this was a successful collaboration. Looking back at our DTR, it seemed like most things got done. I may have mis-estimated the timing aspect of the project. You did a good job at asking questions when you were confused, and I think that definitely helped in making it feel like a collaborative effort.

I would say that we would still need to work on focusing our work efforts, the pomodoro timing really helped. Also, I think that there were some gaps in the testing, in that we didn't necessarily focus on "bad paths" when we had a time crunch towards the end of the project.

Overall, I thought we had a good project. I felt that I could honestly express my opinions throughout the project, and I learned a lot.
